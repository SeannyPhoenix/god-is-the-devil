# A Concise Synopsis of Christianity
## My understanding of the Bible and its tenets as taught to me in my early life

There is an all-powerful eternal being, called, among various names, God. This God has a host of beings who reside with him in his eternal realm. They have a hierarchy and roles.

God created the universe. This includes all time, matter, energy. This creation was somewhere between six and seven thousand years ago. As the Creator, God has all authority over this creation, and may do as He sees fit with any of it. 

God seems to have focused on Earth. He created the land, sea, and sky, along with the sun and other heavenly bodies. He also created plants and animals.

Finally, he created humans, Adam, then Eve, in a paradise on earth called Eden. God set only one rule: Adam and Eve were not to eat fruit from a tree God placed in Eden.

At some point, one of the higher beings in God’s host decided that it was not fair for God to be preeminent and led a faction of the host in rebellion. For this, God punished them. The leader in this rebellion is known as the devil.

The devil, who was able to freely access God’s creation, convinced Eve, and thus Adam, to also reject God’s law. They ate the fruit, and God punished them by ejecting them from Eden forever. He also killed animals and made clothes for them.

This changed things. Because Adam and Eve made a single choice, God punished all humanity with a curse for all time. All people would suffer from pain, toil, sickness, and death. One could choose to honor God by choosing to worship Him and make pleasing sacrifices.

From this point, God made it clear that he would choose favorites. When Adam and Eve’s sons Cain and Abel grew up, they each made offerings to God. God liked Abel's offering, which was animals, but disnt like Cain's, which was crops. This also set the expectation for all future sacrifices to God: He required the death and burning of flesh.

God had many more rules, and humanity as a whole violated those rules. These laws include abstinence from violence, drunkenness, and sexual promiscuity. When he’d had enough, God decided to cleanse them from the earth through a global flood. He chose his favorite at the time, Noah, and instructed him personally to build a giant floating vessel. When the flood violently came, only Noah and his family survived, along with many animals he was instructed to bring along.

After the flood, however, God regretted his actions, and chose the rainbow as a promise that he would never again destroy all of humanity. Then one of Noah’s sons offended Noah, and Noah cursed him and his progeny. This curse established a racial hierarchy, though it is unclear if this curse was enforced by God.



Above all, one must consciously acknowledge Him and one’s place in creation, that is, that one has been created with the ability to choose or reject God’s
