# God Is the Devil; I Am God
### Philosophical Autobiography of Seanny Drakon Phoenix

God Is the Devil; I Am God follws my personal journey from childhood to "now" (whenever I last push to this repository) to explore my personal philosophy. It will refer heavily to important artifacts, such as people, events, and Christianity. I will attempt to explain the religion in which I was raised, and contrast it to my current understanding.

Currently considering writing this in two parts:

## Part 1: God Is the Devil

Part 1 is a breakdown of popular Christianity. I will attempt to illustrate the incinsistencies in the nature of God, and that His truest nature is one of sadistic destruction.

## Part 2: I Am God

Part 2 is a discussion of the true nature and responsibility of man. I will attempt to show that in the absense of a universial deity, every being is god in themselves, and will choose what kind of god they will be.
